        content: "1. - Practice your line work. Be confident in every line you draw. It makes a huge difference.\n2. - Use guidelines instead of trying to draw the final picture from scratch. Even pros use guidelines.\n3. - Start with the basics. Can you draw some good lines? What about simple shapes like circles? Can you do them in 3D? Shapes are used everywhere so you should practice them.\n4. - Use references. Again, even pros use references all the time. Try to analyze your reference, everything about it. Don't mindlessly copy, think about every line and its purpose.\n5. - Lastly, this is the most imporant one: have fun! It's all about consistency and you will not be able to be consistent unless you enjoy the process. If you don't enjoy them, you can skip all previous steps, just draw what makes you feel good.",

        content: "First of all, keep calm and collected. Do not panic.\nYou need to directly point or call to someone and tell them do dial the emergency phoneline (112 in europe). If you just yell \"somebody call 112\", people will assume someone else will call and in the end nobody will.\nIf the person doesn't have a pulse - CHEST COMPRESSIONS. Even if you break a few ribs that doesn't matter. The person is clinically dead already. Doing chest compressions is the only thing at this point which could save him until professionals come to the scene.\nMouth to mouth isn't needed unless the person has drawned.",
