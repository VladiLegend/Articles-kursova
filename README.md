# How to run
Go to the ```backend``` folder, open a terminal and type
```bash
npm i
npm run runDev
```
DO NOT close the terminal window or you will stop the server.


After that, go to the ```frontend``` folder, open a terminal and type
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

It is important that you do not close either of the terminal windows

This will open port 3000 with the application. A browser should automatically be launched, but in case it doesn't, open your
browser of choice and go to ```localhost:3000```

## Note
You need to have node installed.
